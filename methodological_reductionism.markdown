# What does it DO?

`is a framework` tells us nothing

There is a promise of some elusive sense of
but I think we should be very skeptical of these kinds of claims from the
software we use.

# input -> output

I have a naive

# hell is other people (on your team)

...but the framework standardizes

The other people on my team are idiots!

The people you work with might be stubborn, but this is understandable
considering how much froth and 

# convergence

There are two polar ends of convergence.

At one end are very tiny, single-purpose libraries that do just one thing
and at the other end are package managers.

In the middle are kitchen sinks,
and instability.

Modules in the middle are
competition, 

At the low end there is competition too but this competition is more about
variations over the relative importance of different trade-offs.



Cultural

# vertical and horizontal abstractions

# expressive power

is not writability nor readability, but orthogonality and the ease of
recombining abstractions elsewhere.

# the alternative

The alternative is simple,
can be incrementally moved toward from any existing code base,
and you can


and you can always incrementally move 
you are already doing it, 

just not

Stop using scaffolding. Stop generating code with code.
Start from nothingness and work your way up.

If you find yourself performing the same steps multiple times across different
projects, abstract those steps away into a reusable module and publish that
module to a package manager.

At the same time, don't go overboard abstracting away every single thing that
could ever repeat.

# effort

Frameworks offer the same structural benefits as religions: they offer a canned
script of easy answers

but if we dig deeper

For a modest investment
