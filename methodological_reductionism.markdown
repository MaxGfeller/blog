# What does it DO?

`is a framework` tells us nothing

There is a promise of some elusive sense of
but I think we should be very skeptical of these kinds of claims from the
software we use.

# input -> output

I have a naive

# hell is other people (on your team)

...but the framework standardizes

The other people on my team are idiots!

The people you work with might be stubborn, but this is understandable
considering how much froth and 

# convergence

There are two polar ends of convergence.

At one end are very tiny, single-purpose libraries that do just one thing
and at the other end are package managers.

In the middle are kitchen sinks,
and instability.

Modules in the middle are
competition, 

At the low end there is competition too but this competition is more about
variations over the relative importance of different trade-offs.



Cultural

# vertical and horizontal abstractions

# expressive power

is not writability nor readability, but orthogonality and the ease of
recombining abstractions elsewhere.

# the alternative

The alternative is simple,
can be incrementally moved toward from any existing code base,
and you can


and you can always incrementally move 
you are already doing it, 

just not

Stop using scaffolding. Stop generating code with code.
Start from nothingness and work your way up.

If you find yourself performing the same steps multiple times across different
projects, abstract those steps away into a reusable module and publish that
module to a package manager.

At the same time, don't go overboard abstracting away every single thing that
could ever repeat.

# effort

Frameworks offer the same structural benefits as religions: they offer a canned
script of easy answers

but if we dig deeper

For a modest investment

ON THE INHERENT INSTABILITY OF FRAMEWORKS:

06:18:05 < substack> t0lkman: but perhaps they did each of those things better in isolation 
                     instead of writing a kitchen sink of all functionality?
06:18:06 < t0lkman> I mean all those frameworks 
                    http://ocdevel.com/blog/nodejs-frameworks-comparison don't exist just for 
                    nothing
06:18:16 < substack> you can find individual libraries for pretty much everything you need to 
                     do
06:18:30 < substack> and when you can't find one, you can write one and publish it to npm
06:18:36 < substack> and then everybody can benefit
06:18:50 < substack> instead of mutually-exclusive fiefdoms of frameworks that don't 
                     inter-operate
06:23:10 < substack> t0lkman: there will always be more and more and more frameworks because 
                     there is nothing inherent in the problem domain that constrains the 
                     solutions
06:23:20 < substack> it's all opinion, conjecture, and fashion
06:24:05 < substack> but libraries that express a single clear idea about their inputs and 
                     outputs can be evaluated independently on their merits for their narrow 

06:24:10 < substack> we can actually know something about them
06:24:39 < substack> it's much harder to make conclusive statements about expansive frameworks 
                     because they are so multi-faceted
06:25:19 < substack> it goes to the heart of your internal epistemological system

06:26:01 < substack> I happen to be a methodological reductionist because I don't see how we 
                     can make reliable statements about big systems owing to the compounding 
                     factors
06:26:24 < substack> it's the same idea as experimental design: you test only a single 
                     variable at a time and you keep everything else the same
